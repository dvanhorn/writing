Probability is notorious for being stubbornly counterintuitive.
Any automation of probabilistic calculations or reasoning is therefore helpful.
In Bayesian statistics, automation is taking the form of probabilistic languages for specifying random processes, which compute answers to questions about them under constraints.

We believe that any such language should be made to meet a mathematical specification.
The reason is simple: if a probabilistic language implementation is made to always meet its maker's expectations, it is almost certainly wrong.
