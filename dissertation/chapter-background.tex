XXX: Candidates for exposition:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Basic probability
	\item Bayesian inference
	\item Measure theory
	\item $\lambda$-calculus
	\item Operational semantics
	\item Monads, idioms, and arrows
\end{itemize}
This is a lot of background information.
How do I choose?
How do I decide how much to include?
