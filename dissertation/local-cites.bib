But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}

                 particularity is to extend to arbitrary-precision ideas from the IEEE 754 
                 standard, by providing \emph{correct rounding} and \emph{exceptions}.
                 We demonstrate how these strong semantics are achieved --- with no 
                 significant slowdown with respect to other arbitrary-precision tools
                 --- and discuss a few applications where such a library can be useful.",
